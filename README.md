# Unsung-Forest
A game I created using my Byrd Engine (An older version).

I created this game using Byrd Engine, a few years ago. I thought it'd be a cool idea to throw it up on the git hubs.

To run it, run the Frame file, or you can just run the built "Unsung Forest.jar" file.

#### Challenges
This project was built in one week. Yup, one single week. With that comes some lazy lines of code.
Byrd Engine is very OOP friendly, and I suggest making everything an Object. One difficulty for me
was not making the GameUserInterface (gui) its own set of objects. This led to the play file being
bloated and not very scalable. To expand upon what I mean, since I haven't touched the code of this
in a few years, it's near impossible to get back into this project with the same drive because of the
size of the play file.

TL;DR Don't make lazy code.

### Where can I get Byrd Engine and make my own games!?
The developer of Byrd Engine (me) is 19. There isn't any documentation or tutorials of how to use the
Engine properly, and all I have to show for it is this example project. However, with that warning, you can
still view the engine open-source on my github. https://github.com/blbbrayan/Byrd-Engine
